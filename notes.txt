- getElementById - allows you to select the element by its unique ID (we don't use the hashtag for this)
-classList.toggle (will add a class if its not there, or will remove it if it is)

- not gonna lie...i'm so fucking confusion right now 
-if there's a small change in the functions while refactoring, it makes sense to add a parameter as allows you to input small changes in the function
