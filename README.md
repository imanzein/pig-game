# pig-game

This was also a project from the Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course which teaches JavaScript. Similarly to the last game, I tried to challenge myself in during this lecture by trying to see if I code a new component of the game myself PRIOR to watching the tutorial. Again, it's really helped me in playing around with the code and really practice my problem solving skills ðŸŽ‰
